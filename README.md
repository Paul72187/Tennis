## Tennis

# Overview
This tennis app is split into two parts - 1. ManualScore and 2. SimulatedScore.

# 1. Aim (ManualScore)
The ManualScore is designed to follow the format of a best of 5 set tennis match between two players. Users manually input each point of each game for either Player 1 or Player 2 to determine which player wins the point and ultimately who wins each game, each set and the entire match. There is the additional feature to settle a set on a tie-break should the two players make it to 6 games all in a given set.

# 2. Aim (SimulatedScore)
The SimulatedScore is designed to follow the format of a best of 5 set tennis match between two players. Unlike the ManualScore above, the SimulatedScore uses the Random module in Python to generate game, set and match scores at random and therefore the outcome of the match is not determined by user input.
